in this code I suppodes that I have two files
the first one which contains nodes and edges
the second one contains nodes which is highly centralized

simply I will plot the nodes and change the color of the nodes which are highly centralized

The next step I will apply one of the algorithms which computes the centrality then plot the Graph
